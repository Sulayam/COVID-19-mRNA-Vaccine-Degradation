# COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Degradation Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict degradation rates of mRNA molecules at various sequence positions using advanced machine learning techniques. The dataset and problem are based on a Kaggle competition that addresses critical challenges in stabilizing COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. By accurately predicting the degradation rates, this project contributes to improving the shelf-life and efficacy of mRNA-based vaccines.

## Problem Statement
RNA molecules are prone to degradation, a critical limitation in mRNA vaccine technology. This project uses machine learning models to predict:
* **Reactivity**
* **Degradation under Magnesium at pH 10 (deg_Mg_pH10)**
* **Degradation under Magnesium at 50Â°C (deg_Mg_50C)**

The goal is to enable insights into degradation mechanisms and assist researchers in designing more stable mRNA sequences.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing
* Merging additional features with training and test data
* Handling categorical features using Label Encoding
* Ensuring compatibility between train and test datasets

### 2. Machine Learning
* Training an **XGBoost Regressor** for multi-target regression
* Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**
* Evaluating performance using **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)

### 3. Visualization
* Scatter plots to compare predicted vs actual values for each target variable

### 4. Results
* Final predictions are exported as a CSV file (`test_predictions_xgb_tuned.csv`)

## Dataset Description

### Input Files
* `train.csv`: Contains training data with RNA sequences, structures, and target degradation rates
* `test.csv`: Test dataset with RNA sequences and structures (without ground truth targets)
* `df1.csv`: Supplementary data with additional features

### Columns of Interest

#### Features
* `sequence`: RNA sequence (A, G, U, C)

## Usage

### Run the Model
1. **Preprocess the data**:
   * Merges training/test datasets with additional features
   * Encodes categorical features
   * Splits data into training and validation sets

2. **Train the model**:
   * Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
   * Trains the best XGBoost model on the dataset

3. **Predict and save results**:
   * Generates predictions for the test dataset
   * Saves predictions to `test_predictions_xgb_tuned.csv`

### Visualizations
* Use scatter plots to analyze predictions vs actual values for each target variable

### Example Commands
